Notes:

Added a new structure called linker, this links the ready queue and the blocked queue together so in the
find and insert functions I can parse through all of the queues with one address, also, this will make
the show functions easier to do. I think we are also supposed to keep track of how many processes are in the
queue, I figured this would be easiest to do in the comhan function after a successful insertion. Also I just realized
That I changed BLOCK to BLOCKED in the header file. A search and replace should fix that haha sorry.
